# TornadoRax

A collection of OpenStack wrappers for the Tornado web framework. While this is intended
to support all OpenStack providers and services over time, honestly it is mostly used
against Rackspace, hence the "rax". It may transition to tornadostax over time.

Right now it just includes queues (Zaqar eventually) and basic cloud files upload.
Still way early.
